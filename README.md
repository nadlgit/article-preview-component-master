## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla CSS
- CSS grids

### What I learned

My main learning is CSS grids, and I love them. My first attempt to solve this challenge was without them, and it was a nightmare that I didn't finished.

I also learned how to make a bubble (for the social media share icons).

And is was a good exercise to handle responsive design.

### Continued development

- I don't have enough time now, but I would like to see if it can be achieved using less absolute length units.
- It could be enhanced with CSS animations.
- Another point is that I still don't understand how to center vertically the component on screen.
- Also I would like to explore SVG manipulations.
